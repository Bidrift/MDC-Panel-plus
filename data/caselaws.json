            "case": "Terry v. Ohio",
            "summary": "This case established the 'Terry frisk' or 'stop and frisk', allowing police to briefly detain a person for questioning if they have reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. If the officer also reasonably suspects the person is armed and dangerous, they may conduct a pat-down of their outer clothing for weapons.",
            "implication": "Officers can perform a limited pat-down for weapons during an investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion, without needing probable cause for an arrest."

        {
            "id": "miranda-v-arizona",
            "case": "Miranda v. Arizona",
            "summary": "Established that a suspect in custody must be informed of their constitutional rights before being interrogated. These rights include the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Failure to provide this warning can make any subsequent confession inadmissible in court.",
            "implication": "The 'Miranda Rights' must be read to suspects in custody before any interrogation begins. This ensures statements are voluntary and admissible."

            "id": "graham-v-connor",
            "case": "Graham v. Connor",
            "summary": "This ruling sets the 'objective reasonableness' standard for use of force by law enforcement. The force used must be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, considering the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including the severity of the crime, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat, and whether they are actively resisting or attempting to evade arrest.",
            "implication": "All uses of force are judged based on what a reasonable officer would do in the same situation, not with the benefit of hindsight."

        {
            "id": "tennessee-v-garner",
            "case": "Tennessee v. Garner",
            "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled that under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer may not use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect unless the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.",
            "implication": "Deadly force against a fleeing suspect is only justified if they are a significant and immediate danger to others. It cannot be used simply to prevent escape."

        {
            "id": "carroll-v-united-states",
            "case": "Carroll v. United States",
            "summary": "This case created the 'automobile exception' to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. It allows police to search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that evidence or contraband is located in the vehicle. This is due to the mobile nature of vehicles.",
            "implication": "If probable cause exists, a vehicle can be searched on the spot without a warrant because it can be easily moved, potentially taking evidence with it."
        },
        {
            "id": "arizona-v-gant",
            "case": "Arizona v. Gant",
            "summary": "This case narrowed the scope of vehicle searches incident to arrest. Police may search a vehicle's passenger compartment only if it's 'reasonable to believe' that the arrested person might access the vehicle at the time of the search or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense for which they are being arrested.",
            "implication": "The automatic search of a vehicle's entire passenger area after an arrest is no longer permitted. The search must be justified by the possibility of the arrestee accessing the vehicle or the likelihood of finding evidence related to the specific crime of arrest."
        },
        {
            "id": "whren-v-united-states",
            "case": "Whren v. United States",
            "summary": "The court held that as long as an officer has a reasonable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred, they may stop any vehicle, even if the officer's true motive is to investigate a different, unrelated crime for which they lack reasonable suspicion or probable cause (a 'pretextual stop').",
            "implication": "Any valid traffic violation is a legitimate basis for a vehicle stop, regardless of the officer's underlying investigatory motives."
